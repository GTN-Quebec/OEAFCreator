OEAF Creator
============
Collection of mini editors that facilitate the construction of metadata records compliant with the OEAF application profile.

Notes:

For the "Copy to clipboard" button to work, the files must be deployed into a folder accessible from Internet.  To this end, the script bin/deploy.sh copies all the files at the location defined by the environment variable $OEAF_CREATOR_WWW.
