Implement an editor for provider.  We should link to a uri in the CLO editor instead of embedding a sub-editor. 
Implement smaller objects like Person, Organization
Check if type attribute is properly set for RDF.  It is OK for RDFa but not for RDF, I think.
Implement the links between objects (red links from the Global View (Fig. D.1, p.62, Profil_OEAF_v0.7.5))
Implement an editor for relations between objects (6.2.1).
Should we prepend the number t010 before the vocabulary values in the form's list and prepend also some space to indent the hierarchical vocabularies.  As the items are sorted  (and that the number t010 would be taken into account), the items would be shown as declared in the specs.
Text fields will long text values (like description) should be surrounded by CDATA tags to prevent problems when special characters are inserted (like <>&).
Remove ShowURIs option for geolocation.
Add an option to use neutral uri instead or language-specific (either French, English, or another language) or both.
What about the language attribute of the strings?  Should we set the language or not in the header of the html/xhtml? Should the form allow the input of strings in different languages (e.g.: 1 title in English and 1 title in French)? For now, I say no.
Handle langstrings for all elements.
