Bug: In Organization, in RDFa, if we specify a geoloc uri (only) and part uris, the part uris are associated to the geolocation.  Check if we have this problem elsewhere.
Implement RDF Turtle output
Disable syntax highlighting for Turtle.
Use specific types.  For example, date elements should look like "2010-01-01"^^xsd:date, and so on.
Implement all cardinalities for each element.
Is a Geolocation a subclass of a Resource?  If not, we should remove the MLR Record wrapper from the Geolocation form because a MLR Record describes a Resource.
Text fields will long text values (like description) should be surrounded by CDATA tags to prevent problems when special characters are inserted (like <>&).  
    Do I need to convert newlines to backslash-n in such cases?  Hmmm, probably not...  Will do that later.
What about the language attribute of the strings?  Should we set the language or not in the header of the html/xhtml? Should the form allow the input of strings in different languages (e.g.: 1 title in English and 1 title in French)? For now, I say no.
Handle langstrings for all elements.
