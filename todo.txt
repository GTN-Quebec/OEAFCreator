Text fields will long text values (like description) should be surrounded by CDATA tags to prevent problems when special characters are inserted (like <>&).  
    Do I need to convert newlines to backslash-n in such cases?  Hmmm, probably not...  Will do that later.
What about the language attribute of the strings?  Should we set the language or not in the header of the html/xhtml? Should the form allow the input of strings in different languages (e.g.: 1 title in English and 1 title in French)? For now, I say no.
Handle langstrings for all elements.
